convert ply/pnt/pcd to las
read ply or las apply semantica segmentation to identify the lables of each points, using RANDLA-net similar neural network
using points mask to filter the building out of the entire scene. 
using nearest neighbour search and dbscan to cluster the buildings in the filtered points
do reconstrcution based on these points using whatever algorithem
save the reconstructed 3d models into backend, and save their metadata into database
(center points, classfication, vertex, faces, district(orignal data source and related point cloud))

point cloud can be written into database or saved as ply/laz


for front end visualization:
convert 3dmodels into 3dtiles
using Cesium 3d-tiles
